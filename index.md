# Osm

Hey!

**Osm** is a PHP application development framework.

Symfony, Laravel and other frameworks are great, and Osm is not a replacement to them. It's one more tool for your toolbox. You can use Osm framework with the other framework, or you can build applications using the Osm framework alone - you'll get its benefits either way:

1. **It's modular**. Combine your application from the existing building blocks - modules, and build your own.
2. **It's extensible**. Change behavior of any class, in any module you use, without changing its source code.
3. **It's simple**. Concentrate on what matters.
4. **It's very fast**. No code is executed, unless you actually need it.
5. **You are fast, too**. Add a new console command by just extending the right class, add a new option to it by adding a class property - you get the idea.

## Contribute

Osm is in active development, and **we need your help**, be it a reported bug, an occasional pull request, or full fledged participation. It's your opportunity to build something great and be around like-minded people. Do participate, [contact us](https://github.com/osmianski).
